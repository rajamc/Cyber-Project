A Cybersecurity Model is a framework or plan used by organizations to assess their maturity level in identifying cybersecurity threats and risks. It guides the selection of policies, strategies and programs to defend against threats and mitigate risk.
NIST Cyber Security Framework is implemented in the project.
NIST framework was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).It emphasizes risk tolerance, continuous monitoring  and adaptive strategies.
The five important phases of the framework are,
*	Identify: Understand risks, sensitive information and critical business operations.
*	Protect : Organize defences for critical security components.
*	Detect  : Establish effective monitoring tools.
*	Respond : Develop incident response procedures.
*	Recover : Restore systems after incidents

By adopting NIST Cyber security framework, the company was able to identify the risks and threats. Created a defence mechanism using the SIEM and Firewall setup. Network monitoring was performed by analysing the logs and threat. It also helped to prepare mitigation strategy by responding to threat and procedures to recover the system and network after any incidents.
